For this mini project, we will practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas,
and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform 
the data. After we  transform the data, we will create four CSV files and use the
CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we wil upload the CSV
file data into a Postgres database.

In Part I of this challenge, we import crowdfunding data from an Excel file into
a Pandas DataFrame. We briefly investiagate the data and then we extract data to
create new columns. Then we:
1. create arrays using numpy
2. use list comprehension to add prefixes to each element of the array
3. create separate dataframes 

After creating two separate dataframes, we create a third dataframe that contains
contact information. This processs involves using 'regex' to extract various strings.

Finally, we export the dataframes to CSV

In Part 2 of this challenge, we create an entity relationship diagram based on the CSV files 
we created. Then, we created schema in Postgresql. Finally, we imported the data and verified
its accuracy.
